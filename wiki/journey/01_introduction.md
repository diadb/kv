# Journey 01 - Introduction

This is a very ambitious project that will probably lead to nowhere. Still there
is something about it that grabs my interest. What other reason would I want?

It's not considered a good thing to learn a programming language and a new editor
at the same time, right? We should always minimize frustration through the
learning process. Because of this, I'll split this project in 4 parts.

1. Rust.

Rust is a relatively new programming language with cool ideas reggarding
ownership & life-cycle without garbage collection. It also has a very
nice type system.

2. Data structures and algorithms
3. Distributed systems
4. Low-level IO optimizations

I have two goals with this project: learning and teaching. I'll write about 
each step, each new concept, things that worked and things that didn't work.
Hopefully
